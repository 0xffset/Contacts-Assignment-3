This is assignment #3 about how to consume a service using WebAPI as part of my third web programming appointment. To see the webpage running, you should click [here](https://personal-webpage-assigment-one.herokuapp.com/) to see previsualization.

### Disclaimer 
This project is deployed using [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and PHP. Why? Foremost, Heroku has a free-not-cost deployment of at least 5 personal projects, so itâ€™s useful for this kind of assignment. However, Heroku does not permit the deployment of static web pages using HTML, so using the following PHP snippet of code ```<?php include_once("index.html");?>``` in an ```index.php``` to include it the corresponding HTML file.
