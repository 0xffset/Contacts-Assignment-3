### Third Web Programming Assignment  (Contact WebAPI Consumption)

This is assignment #3 about how to consume a service using WebAPI as part of my third web programming appointment. To see the webpage running, you should click [here](https://contacts-assignment-three.herokuapp.com/) to see previsualization.

### Disclaimer 
This project is deployed using [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and PHP. Why? Foremost, Heroku has a free-not-cost deployment of at least 5 personal projects, so it’s useful for this kind of assignment. However, Heroku does not permit the deployment of static web pages using HTML, so using the following PHP snippet of code ```<?php include_once("index.html");?>``` in an ```index.php``` to include it the corresponding HTML file.
